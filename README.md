Project Title: Real Estate Market Price Analysis
 “Are we facing another “bubble”? Name of Group: Insane Data Prophets Team Members: Dan Dragone, Billy Martinez, Pavana Srinivasa, Roma Patel

Project Description/Outline: Our group decide to analyze the real estate market variation over time, analyze the increase/decrease in comparison with the inflation rates. Closer analysis comparing the years before the last crisis (subprime crisis 2007-2010) and the market price variation since then. Also to predict the real estate market prices (regression).                                   Ideally, we will have the ability to answer if we are facing a new bubble.

Data Sources: Real estate data sources (3):https://www.usabledatabases.com/#contact-us , https://www.realtor.com/research/data , https://www.zillow.com/research/ztrax/

Inflation rate sources: http: …

Federal Reserve Interest rates: http:…

(TBD) – Loan rates / mortgage http://...

Research Questions to Ask: scope:

We will evaluate the Real Estate market variation by zip code.
our analysis is going back to 2000 or maybe 1996 (12 years before the subprime crisis 2008)

Goals:
Determine the cities/zip codes with greatest and lowest market price variation. After and before subprime crisis
Predict the real estate market prices for 2 specific zip code - up to 2 years from now.
Answer the question: “Are we facing another “bubble”?
Charts we plan to use:
(bar chart): top 10 zip codes with greatest market price variation
             top 10 zip codes with lowest market price variation
line chart: (over time) real estate market price vs inflation rate vs fed interest rates
            (over time) 11-12 years before subprime crisis
            (over time) 11-12 years after subprime crisis
Google maps plot for the top 10 zip codes with greatest and lowest market variation.
Regression Analysis for After the Crisis Trend.
