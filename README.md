Project Title: Real Estate price variation – are we facing a new bubble?
Name of Group: Insane Data Prophets
Team Members: Dan Dragone, Billy Martinez, Pavana Srinivasa, Roma Patel

Project Description/Outline:
Our group is looking to analyze the real estate market variation over time, analyze the increase/decrease in comparison with the inflation rates and a closer analysis comparing the years before the last crisis (subprime crisis 2007-2008) and the market price variation since then. Ideally, we will have the ability to answer if we are facing a new bubble.

Research Questions to Ask:
scope:
- We will evaluate the Real Estate market variation by zip code.
- our analysis is going back to 2000 or maybe 1996 (12 years before the subprime crisis 2008)






Goals:
- Determine the cities/zip codes with greatest and lowest market price variation. After and before subprime crisis
- Predict the real estate market prices for 2 specific zip code - up to 2 years from now.
- Answer the question: “Are we facing another “bubble”?
 
 
Charts we plan to use:
- (bar chart) top 10 zip codes with greatest market price variation
- (bar chart) top 10 zip codes with lowest market price variation
- line chart (over time)  real estate market price vs inflation rate vs fed interest rates
- Line chart (over time) 11-12 years before subprime crisis
- Line chart (over time) 11-12 years after subprime crisis
- Google maps plot for the top 10 (or 5) zip codes with greatest and lowest market variation
- regression to define the market price of the top 5 greatest variation zip codes (up to 2 years from now)
